# A-Comprehensive-Classification-Model-for-Predicting-Wildfires-with-Uncertainty
Using a comprehensive dataset consisting 1713 samples: 1327 instances of the class “no_fire” and 386 instances of the “fire” class, I used 11 classification models to predict whether or not there is an occurrence of wildfire using the three feature variables: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Thermal Anomalies (referred to as the BURNED_AREA in the dataset). The aim of this work is to compare the performance of different Machine learning models (with careful hyperparameter selection) for wildfire prediction.
